# 🧠 Mental Health in Students Post-COVID: A Silent Crisis?

> A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook revealing patterns, signals, and hidden truths about students' mental health post the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health concerns among students have grown significantly. This project explores a rich dataset to uncover insights into depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and more across variables like gender, age, degree type, study hours, sleep, and living environment.

This isn't just a plot-heavy notebook. The aim is to **narrate real stories through data**, highlight **vulnerable student groups**, and start **conversations around psychological well-being in academia**.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Identify demographic groups most affected by depression and anxiety.
- Analyze correlations between study hours, sleep patterns, and mental health issues.
- Understand how degree types and academic stress influence psychological well-being.
- Present findings in a visually intuitive and engaging manner using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
